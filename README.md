# miscellaneous
A small repo for all of my miscellaneous scripts and python prgrams
A couple of different files. Just copies of the originals as most are there just to help do something specific in a single directory
the retag was fun to do, it used eyeD3. I was retagging my music, and realized I could automate a script instead of typing the same thing over and over.
The python ones are mostly homework help, simplifying algorithms. It helped me understand basic math concepts in python
